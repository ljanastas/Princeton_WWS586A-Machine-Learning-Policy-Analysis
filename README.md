## Topics covered

* Policy analysis in the digital age

* Programming in R, R Notebooks & Github

* Data acquisition and cleaning: APIs & webscraping

* Natural language processing: tokenization, text processing, document-term matrix, TF-IDF weighting.

* Introduction to statistical learning theory: bias-variance tradeoff, training, testing, cross-validation.

* Model selection: regularization, LASSO, Bayesian LASSO.

* Supervised learning: kNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees, SVMs, Neural Networks.

* Unsupervised learning: k-means clustering, latent dirichlet allocation (topic models).

* Special topics: machine learning and causal inference: Bayesian structural time series.
