It is true that
nature-worship was not the sole primitive religious conception of mankind. Various other

In the Sanskrit Dictionary, compiled more than

two thousand years ago, we find a full account of the
incarnate deity Vishnu, who appeared in human form

37
as Crishna.

Vishnu, being moved to relieve the

earth of her load of misery and sin, came down
from heaven, and was born of the virgin Devaki, on
the twenty-fifth of December.
(See NOTE i.)

heaven danced and sang; and at midnight, when
the Support of All was born, the clouds emitted low,
pleasing sounds, and poured down rain of flowers."
Though of royal descent (he was of the Yadava
line, the oldest and noblest of India) he was born
in a cave, his mother being on a journey with his
foster-father, on their way to the city, to pay his
yearly tribute or tax to the king.
At Crishna's birth the cave was brilliantly illuminated, and the faces of his father and mother

emitted rays of glory.

The divine child was recognized by cowherds,
who prostrated themselves before him. He was
and presented with
sandal-wood and perfumes.
Soon after his
birth he was visited by the holy prophet Nared,
who had heard of the fame of the infant. Nared

The

flat roof of this cavern-temple, and every other
circumstance connected with it, proves that its origin
must be referred to a very remote epoch, hundreds

of years before our era.

Crishna was preceded by Rama, who was born a
short time before his birth and

It is said that Crishna astonished his teachers by
his precocious wisdom. Various miracles are related
as occurring in his childhood, some of them being
the childhood of Jesus

similar to those related of

Christ in the Apocryphal New Testament.
One of Crishna's first miracles, in his maturity,
was the healing of a leper. He restored the maimed,
the deaf, and the blind; he healed the sick and
raised the dead he supported the weak against the

Crishna was crucified, and is represented with
arms extended, hanging on a cross, the nail-prints
being visible in hands and feet, and with the spearwound in his side. One account speaks of him as

There was a tradition among the early Christians
that Annas was high priest when Jesus was crucified.
This is evident from the Acts (iv. 5). Now, Annas,
or Annias, was not high-priest until the year 48 A. D. 2
Therefore, if Jesus was crucified at that time, he
must have been about fifty years of age. It is true

AN EXPLANATION OF THE FABLE, IN WHICH THE SUN
WORSHIPPED UNDER THE NAME OF CHRIST.

IS

IT is a fact that at the hour of midnight on the 2$th of
December, in the centuries when Christianity made its
appearance, the celestial sign, which rose at the horizon,
and the ascendant of which presided at the opening of the
new solar revolution, was the Virgin of the constellations.
It is another fact, that the God Sun, born at the winter
solstice, is re-united with her and surrounds her with his

Assumption, or the
another fact is,
that, when she comes out heliacally from the solar rays
at that moment, we celebrate her appearance in the

winter produces, and presumed in the sacerdotal fictions
to be born at the solstice, must remain yet three months

F.

AN EXPLANATION OF THE HERACLEID, OR OF THE SACRED
POEM ON THE TWELVE MONTHS AND ON THE SUN,
WORSHIPPED UNDER THE NAME OF HERCULES.

THE following comparison of the legend of Hercules
with the constellations which preside over the twelve
months

is

from Dupuis.

(See Origin of All Religions, pp.

87-93-)

Whatever may have been the opinions about Hercules,
he was surely not a petty Grecian prince, renowned for his
romantic adventures. It is the mighty luminary, which
animates and

fructifies

the universe, the divinity which

has been honored everywhere by the erection of temples
and altars, and consecrated in religious song by all nations.

From Meroe

in Ethiopia, and Thebes in Upper Egypt, to
the British Isles and to the snows of Scythia from ancient

shores of the Atlantic Ocean from the forests of Germany

Planets, of nourisher of mankind, of the God whose

glowing orb revolves eternally around the Earth, and who
while followed in his track by the Year, the daughter of
Time and mother of the Twelve Months, draws along in
regular succession the seasons, which renew and reproduce
themselves, are so many traits of the Sun, that we should

recognize them even if the poet had not given to his Hercules the name of Helios, or the Sun.
The author of the hymns which are attributed to Or-

pheus describes in the most precise manner the affinity,
or rather the identity, of Hercules with the Sun.
The
Phoenicians have consequently preserved the tradition that
Hercules was the Sun-god, and that his twelve labors

represented the journey of this luminary through the
twelve signs of the zodiac. Porphyrius, born in Phoenicia,
makes the same assertion.

"The Egyptians," says Plutarch, "thought that Hercules
had his seat in the Sun, and that he travelled with it
around the world." The scholiast of Hesiod tells us also
"that the zodiac, in which the Sun accomplishes its annual course, is the real career which Hercules travels over
in the fable of the twelve labors, and that by his
marriage
with Hebe, the goddess of youth, we must understand
the year which renews itself at the end of each revolution."

It is

evident that

if

Hercules

is

the Sun, as

is

shown by

the above-cited authorities, the fable of the twelve labors
is a solar fable which can have reference
only to the twelve
months and to the twelve signs, of which the Sun travels

over one in each month.

This inference shall become a
demonstration by the comparison which we shall make of
each of the labors with each one of the months, or with
the signs and constellations which mark the division of
time in the heavens during each of the months.

Amongst the different epochs at which formerly the year
began, that of the summer solstice was one of the most
remarkable. It was on the return of the Sun to this point
that the Greeks fixed the celebration of their

Olympic
which was attributed to Hercules
this was the origin of the most ancient era of the
Greeks. We shall therefore fix the departure of the Sun

in the Pastes of Ovid, in Columella, and chiefly in the
ancient calendars which we have published as a sequel to
