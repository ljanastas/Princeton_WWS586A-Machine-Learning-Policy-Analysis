The

skill

and success with

which Mr. Smith struggled against all these difficulties show more plainly than ever what a loss Assyrian research has sustained in him.
vertheless, even the genius of Mr. Smith could

not do more than give a general idea of the contents
comof the fragments, and not always even this.

A

parison of the translations contained in the present
edition with those contained in the preceding ones

show to what an extent the details of translation
have had to be modified and changed, sometimes with
important consequences. Thus the corrected transwill

of the fragments relating to the Tower of
Babel will remove the doubts raised by Mr. Smith's
translation as to his correctness in associating them

with that event; thus, too, the corrected rendering
of a passage in the Izdubar Epic will show that the

but from a Babylonian library. But it agrees exactly
with the corresponding parts of the Assyrian editions

by myself

as being apparently the

Babylonian version of the biblical account of the
destruction of Sodom and Gomorrah.

Numerous alterations and insertions have had to
be made in the text which accompanies the translations.
The latter necessarily occupied the main
part of Mr. Smith's attention; he had neither time
nor inclination to enter very elaborately into the
questions raised by them, or the illustrations they

might receive from elsewhere. In fact, any adequate
treatment of the great Izdubar Epic, for instance,
demanded a special acquaintance with the method
and results of Comparative Philology, as well as a

more intimate knowledge of its history and character
than was possible at the time when Mr. Smith
wrote.

A large proportion of the cuneiform texts from
which the translations contained in the present volume

named from their opening lines. A distinction is

drawn between those that belonged to the Accadian
period, and were written by Accadian poets in the
Accadian language, and those that were of Semitic
Babylonian origin. The interest of the list is enhanced by the great antiquity of the poems it records, none of them being later than about 2000 B.C.

three hundred years after the captivity of the Jews in
Babylon, the great antiquity of these traditions could

not be proved with certainty, much less their independence of the accounts which we have in Genesis.

On

the discovery and decipherment of the cuneiform inscriptions, Oriental scholars hoped that copies

of the Babylonian histories and traditions would one
day be found, and that earlier and more satisfactory

evidence as to

these primitive histories

than had

previously been accessible, would thus be gained.
In the mound of Kouyunjik, opposite the town of

Mosul, Mr. Layard discovered part of the Royal

Assyrian library, and further collections, also forming
part of this library, have been subsequently found

by Mr. H. Rassam, Mr. Loftus, and Mr. George Smith.
Sir Henry Rawlinson, who made the preliminary
examination of Mr. Layard's treasures, arid was the
first to recognize their value, estimated the number
of fragments brought from this Library at over twenty
thousand.

same name had already been read on the fragment of
another tablet numbered K 231, which turned out to
belong to the same series of tablets as the newly-found
account of the Deluge. Mr. Smith was thus encou-

raged to make a search for other portions of the

series.

The search was a long and heavy work, for there
were thousands of fragments to be examined, and
these were so small, and contained so little of the text,
that it was extremely difficult to ascertain their
meaning. The search, however, proved successful.
A fragment of another copy of the Deluge was found
containing a second account of the sending forth of
the birds.
Several other portions of the same tablet

were gradually collected and

into close relation with the southern

kingdom of Babylonia. Babylonia was at the time
under the sway of a foreign dynasty of Kosssean
princes from the mountains of Elam, which was overthrown, as we learn from the Assyrian records, about
B.C. 1270.

accession of Sargon came a revival of
literature in Assyria ; education became more general,

ancient texts were brought from Babylonia to be
copied, and the antiquarian study of early literature

became fashionable.
Sennacherib, son of Sargon, B.C. 704, continued to
add to his father's library at Calah, but late in his
reign he removed the collection from that city to

Nineveh (Kouyunjik), where from this time forth
the national library remained until the fall of the

which will be translated further on, he takes the
place of the classical Fate, and determines the laws
of the universe generally, and of the stars in particular.
It is evident, from the opening of the inscription

on the

first

tablet of the great Chaldean

work on astrology and astronomy,

that the functions

of the stars were according to the Babylonians to act
not only as regulators of the seasons and the year,

those ages it was generally believed that
the heavenly bodies gave, by their appearance and

which were coming on the

earth.

The expression "judge judgment

be compared with the expression of Genesis (i. 18.)
that the sun and moon were set "to rule over the

day and over the night."

An

account of the creation

of the sun probably followed upon that of the creation
of the moon.

The

creation of the moon, however,

making the sun-god the son of the moon-god.
The details of the creation of the planets and
stars, which would have been very important to us,
are unfortunately lost, no further fragment of this
tablet having been recovered.

The colophon

at the close of the tablet gives us,

however, part of the first line of the sixth tablet, but
not enough to determine its subject. It is probable
that this dealt with the creation of creatures of the

water and fowls of the

air,

and that these were the

creation of Bel, the companion deity to Anu.

The black-headed race of Senin later

was the Turanian population of
the adjoining districts on the east of Babylonia, whereas it is plain that the Accadian hymns
mean by the black-headed race the Accadian people
itself.
It was over them that Sargon of Agane, the

the Accadians, is contrasted with the people of Syria,

and since the Syrians were Semites, the white race
must have been synonymous in the language of the Accad ians Avith Semitic.

As

a matter of

the Se-

fact,

mites belong to the white- skinned division of mankind, and were accordingly painted yellow by the
Egyptians. The Accadian population, on the other

hand, belonged to the dark-skinned division, though
it is not necessary to suppose them to have been as
Muck as the negro or the u blameless Ethiopian." In
the bilingual tablets, the black race is rendered in
"
Assyrian by the word Adamatu or red-skins."

A

popular etymology connected this word Adamatu with the word Adamu or admu, " man," partly

on account of the similarity of sound, partly because
in the age of Accadian supremacy and literature, the
the special human beings made by
the Creator, were the dark-skinned race of Accad.

It is difficult not to compare the serpent of
Genesis with this serpent of Babylonian mythology.
No Chaldean legend of the Fall has as yet been found,

but when we remember

how few Chaldean

legends
have been discovered, and that even for these we are
dependent on the selection and copies of Assyrian
scribes, we need not be surprised that such should be
the case.

The Babylonian colouring of the history

in Genesis, the fact that the rivers of Paradise are

rivers,

and that the

tree of life

was

fa-

miliar to Babylonian art and tradition, make it probable that we shall yet discover the Chaldean version

of the Fall of

instance of the variations which constantly occur in the

This fable has evidently some direct connection
with the mythical history of Babylonia, for Etana is

Many of these originated
in different parts of the country, so that a long period

they celebrated were traditions in the country before

they were embodied in poems and committed to
writing, we must go back to quite a remote epoch for
their first starting-point.

the Evechous of Berosus, and reigned first after the
Flood. Moses of Khorene identified him with Bel,

the great god of Babylon; and he is said to have
extruded liis dominions to the foot of the Armenian

mountains, falling in battle there when attempting
to enforce his authority over Haic, king of Armenia.
Other writers identified Nimrod with Ninus, the
mythical founder of the city of Nineveh.

These

research took up the matter but so wide a door was

Nimrod with the Alorus of Berosus, the first king

Khumbaba, the Kombabos

of the Greeks, was the
of
Geryon. He dwelt far away in the
prototype
forest of pines and sherbin cedars, where the gods

and

spirits

had

their abode.

It was, consequently, in

the cold region of the Accadian Olympus, now Mount
Elwend, that he was placed by the old mythology,

and the similarity of

his

name

to that of the Elamite

DESTRUCTION OF KHTTMBABA.

217

god Khumba or Khumbume makes it possible that
he was originally identical with the latter.
In this
case the antagonism between Khumbaba and Izdubar
would have been merely a reflection of the antagonism that existed between the inhabitants of
Babylonia and the subjects of the Elamite empire.
Mr. Smith even thought that the overthrow of Khumbaba might have been an echo of the overthrow of

some Elamite dynasty by a Chaldean one.
In the case of the fourth tablet Mr. Smith believed
that he had found fragments of all six columns, but
some of these fragments are useless

until

further fragments to complete them.

Here we see that Izdubar, impressed with the

prayer and sacrifice to Samas to aid him in his task.

to Istar, with a view also to gain her aid in the
enterprise.

be heard in the tale of the

Sleeping Beauty.
among the banking records of the Egibi firm in Babylonia notes on
the 15th day of the month Tammuz or June "an
eclipse of the

Moon," apparently

in reference to the

descent of the Moon-goddess Istar into Hades.
The
legend survives in a changed form in the Talmud

(Yoma

Here

it

is

said that

after the Captivity the elders of the nation,

headed

by Ezra and Nehemiah, besought God

demon

that the

of lust might be delivered into their hands. In spite
of a prophetic voice which warned them of the con-

sequences of their request, it was persisted in, and
the demon was given up to them and imprisoned.
But before three days were over, the whole course of
the world was thrown into disorder.

XISCTURUS OB NOAH AND IZDUBAR; FROM AN EARLT
BABYLONIAN CYLINDER.

This passage closes the great Epic of the ancient
Chaldeans, which even in its present mutilated form is
of the greatest importance in relation to the civilization,
manners, and customs of that early people. The main
feature in this part of the Izdubar legends is the
description of the Flood in the eleventh tablet, which

evidently refers to the same event as the Flood of

Noah

in Genesis.

AND CONCLUSION.

301

The episode of the Flood has been introduced into
the Izdubar Epic in accordance with the principle
upon which it has been formed. The eleventh tablet
or book answers to the sign of Aquarius and the
month called u the rainy " by the Accadians, and it

was therefore rightly occupied by the story of the

points that strike us on comparing
the Biblical and cuneiform accounts together is that

first

they both agree in representing the Flood as a punishment for the sins of mankind. This agreement is

rendered remarkable by the absence of such a moral
cause in the legends of a deluge current among other
nations;

it

is

wanting even in the version of the

Babylonian account given by Berosus. Equally remarkable is the agreement of the two accounts in the
narrative of the sending forth of the birds, two of

Berosus in his history has given an account of ten
Chaldean kings who reigned before the Flood, and the
close of this period is well known from the descriptions

several of the Babylonian cities were built before the
Flood, and various arts were known, including writing.

After

1500, the literature

of Babylonia is

legends for some centuries. In the meantime Egypt

supplies a few notices bearing on the subject, which
serve to show that knowledge of them was still kept

up.
Nearly thirteen hundred years before the
Christian era one of the Egyptian poems likens a

hero to the Assyrian chief, Kazartu, a great hunter.
Kazartu probably means a "strong" or "powerful"
one, and it has already been suggested that the
reference

is

to the hero

Nimrod.

A

little later, in

the period extending from B.C. 1000 to 800, we have
in Egypt several persons named Namurot, which

seems to be an echo of the name of the mighty
hunter.
